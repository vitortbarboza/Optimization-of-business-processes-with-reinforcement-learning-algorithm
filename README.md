Optimizing warehouse flows with the Q-learning algorithm

This project consists of building an algorithm to optimize the flow of a warehouse.  
A robot will be responsible for picking up the goods at different points in the warehouse and the goal of the algorithm is to optimize the route to be taken. 
The algorithm was built in Python, and the algorithm used was Q-Learning. 
The data for the problem was simulated in Python.
